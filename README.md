Black Ops Backpack Buddy (BOBB) â€“ Zombies Reminder Tool
Welcome to the Zombie Game Reminder Tool! Or BOBB (Black Ops Backpack Buddy). This project was developed to enhance the user experience in the popular zombie survival game added with the release of Black Ops 6, by providing an on-screen overlay with essential information and quick-reference tools, including an ID passcode reminder, an item checklist, and a basic calculator for the Easter Egg wonder weapon formula.

Note: This tool is in the early release phase, and feedback is highly appreciated.

Project Overview
The Zombie Game Helper Tool is a simple yet effective solution for players who want to track game objectives without interrupting gameplay. This initial version allows users to enter key codes, check off collected items, and access an on-screen calculator to assist with more complex calculations needed to complete the Easter Egg in Zombies Terminus (for now).

Future Goals:
Damage Calculator: Plans are in place to add features that track damage, enemy strength, and other combat stats based on rounds. This will compare player damage output with enemy strength, offering a recommended value that indicates how strong the player should be before facing enemies. This will serve as an indicator of how the player stacks up against the ever-growing strength of the horde.

Game Bar Integration: Exploring compatibility with the Xbox Game Bar on Windows, allowing seamless in-game access.

Further Development & Community Feedback: User feedback will drive future improvements, including the adoption of "Liberty Falls" and upcoming content. (Once finalized, the tool should be easy to maintain, with simple name changes still serving as a checklist or reminder for the main Easter Egg. New possible tools will be added to help players stay on track. Players should not be "hand-held," but view the tool as a "handy help." Contributions to the code and suggestions for new features are very welcome!)
